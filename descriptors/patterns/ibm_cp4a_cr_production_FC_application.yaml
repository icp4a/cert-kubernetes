  ##########################################################################
  shared_configuration:
    ## CP4A patterns or capabilities to be deployed.  This CR represents the "application" pattern (aka Business Automation Application)
    sc_deployment_patterns: application

   

    ## The optional components to be installed if listed here.  This is normally populated by the User script based on input from the user.
    ## The optional components are: app_designer,ae_data_persistence
    sc_optional_components: 

    ## The deployment context, which has a default value of "CP4A".  Unless you are instructed to change this value or 
    ## know the reason to change this value, please leave the default value.
    sc_deployment_context: "CP4A"    

    ## Enable/disable ECM (FNCM) / BAN initialization (e.g., creation of P8 domain, creation/configuration of object stores,
    ## creation/configuration of CSS servers, and initialization of Navigator (ICN)).  If the "initialize_configuration" section
    ## is defined with the required parameters in the CR (below) and sc_content_initialization is set to "true" (or the parameter doesn't exist), then the initialization will occur.  
    ## However, if sc_content_initialization is set to "false", then the initialization will not occur (even with the "initialize_configuration" section defined)
    sc_content_initialization: false

    sc_egress_configuration:
      ## Required. Enable or disable egress access to external systems.
      ## If "sc_restricted_internet_access" is defined and has no value set, then default will be "true". 
      ## If "sc_restricted_internet_access" is not defined (e.g., in the case of upgrade, the existing CR will not have sc_restricted_internet_access), then "sc_restricted_internet_access" will be "false"
      sc_restricted_internet_access: true
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes API server namespace(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`.
      ## "{}" can also be used as a value.  It is equivalent to all namespaces (eg: namespaceSelector:{})
      ## Default are "openshift-kube-apiserver", "openshift-apiserver" for OCP and ROKS.
      sc_api_namespace:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes API server port(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`. 
      ## Default are 443,6443 for OCP and ROKS
      sc_api_port:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes DNS service namespace(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`.
      ## "{}" can also be used as a value.  It is equivalent to all namespaces (eg: namespaceSelector:{})
      ## Default is "openshift-dns" for OCP and ROKS
      sc_dns_namespace:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes DNS service port(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`. 
      ## Default are 53,5353 for OCP and ROKS
      sc_dns_port:

    ## For ROKS, this is used to enable the creation of ingresses. The default value is "false", which routes will be created.
    sc_ingress_enable: false

    ## For ROKS Ingress, provide TLS secret name for Ingress controller. If you are not using ROKS, comment out this line.
    sc_ingress_tls_secret_name: <Required>

    ## If your Openshift cluster is configured for Hugepages and you want the applicable deployment resources to consume Hugepages.
    ## You must set "true" for sc_hugepages.enabled. Default is "false".
    ## You must set type for "Hugepages" like hugepages-2Mi or hugepages-1Gi. Default is "hugepages-2Mi".
    ## You must set size for value which is suitable for Openshift cluster.
    sc_hugepages:
      enabled: false
      type: ""
      value: ""

    ## This optional property is a string value corresponding to the “ipFamilyPolicy” property of the Kubernetes “service” object.
    ## This setting becomes particularly relevant in dual-stack environments where both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled. 
    ## Here are the options you can specify for ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack , PreferDualStack , RequireDualStack
    ## Only set this property if you want the “ipFamilyPolicy” property of the services created for CP4BA to be configured differently from the cluster-level settings. 
    ## Warning: Setting this property to a value not supported by your cluster will cause CP4BA deployment to fail.
    sc_service_ip_family_policy: 

    ## This optional property is a list value corresponding to the “ipFamilies” property of the Kubernetes “service” object.
    ## This parameter works in conjunction with the ipFamilyPolicy to define the IP addressing behaviors for the Service.
    ## You can set it to any of the following array values: ["IPv4"],["IPv6"],["IPv4","IPv6"] (dual-stack environment)
    ## Only set this property if you want the “ipFamilies” property of the services created for CP4BA to be configured differently from the cluster-level settings. 
    ## Warning: Setting this property to a value not supported by your cluster will cause CP4BA deployment to fail.
    sc_service_ip_families:  

    ## Optional setting for secure computing mode (seccomp) profile for CP4A containers.  The default seccomp profile is RuntimeDefault on OCP 4.11 (k8s v1.24) or higher. seccomp profile won't be created on OCP 4.10 (k8s v1.23) or lower.
    ## For more information on seccomp please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/ and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/security/seccomp-profiles.html
    ## NOTE: Defining a custom, localhost seccomp profile that is stricter than the default RuntimeDefault profile may cause our pods fail to start.  This custom profile should be created at the worker nodes.
    sc_seccomp_profile:
    #  type: # RuntimeDefault, Localhost, Unconfined
    #  localhost_profile: # Local path of custom seccomp profile when type `Localhost` is used. The custom profile must be accessible by the pod and must exist locally on all worker nodes.  For example: `/profiles/fine-grained.json`.

    ## Enable/disable FIPS mode for the deployment (default value is "false")
    ## Note: If set as "true", in order to complete enablement of FIPS for CP4BA, please refer to "FIPS wall" configuration in IBM documentation.
    enable_fips: false
