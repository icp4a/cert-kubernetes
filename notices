The Academic Free License
v.2.1

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
e) to display the Original Work publicly.
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
5) This section intentionally omitted.
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without the express written permission of its copyright owner.

   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The "Artistic License"

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

4. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone 
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database 
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone 
  Database section 7.

  7.  Database Ownership

    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the 
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not 
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to 
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ 
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations 
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the 
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent 
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF 
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution
    to the database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
    contribution or in the TZ Database.

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 


Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software 
and other kinds of works. 

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to 
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the 
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these 
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have 
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if 
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that 
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) 
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains 
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and 
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions. 

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting 
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such 
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is 
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If 
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to 
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as 
needed to protect the freedom of users. 

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 


TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds 
of works, such as semiconductor masks. 

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and 
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. 

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the 
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making 
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" 
of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. 

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based 
on the Program. 

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well. 

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through 
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" 
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible 
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells 
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent 
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under 
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent 
item in the list meets this criterion. 

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work 
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source 
form of a work. 

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language. 

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other 
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major 
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential 
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating 
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to 
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. 

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all 
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable 
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to 
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System 
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs 
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes 
interface definition files associated with source files for the work, 
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms 
and other parts of the work. 

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can 
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. 

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same 
work. 


2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a 
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your 
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. 

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, 
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having 
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the 
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not 
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for 
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and 
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your 
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. 

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes 
it unnecessary. 

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar 
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. 

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention 
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the 
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures. 

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep 
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive 
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all 
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy 
of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and 
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms 
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 


 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
    and giving a relevant date. 
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released 
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
    all notices". 

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such 
    permission if you have separately received it. 

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so. 

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and 
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not 
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in 
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of 
the aggregate. 

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of 
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable 
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these 
ways: 

 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange. 

 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for 
    as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
    product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the 
    software in the product that is covered by this License, on a 
    durable physical medium customarily used for software 
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with 
    subsection 6b. 

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the 
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) 
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the 
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is 
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you 
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
    subsection 6d. 

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded 
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included 
in conveying the object code work. 

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, 
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for 
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally 
used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, 
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which 
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the 
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the 
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the 
product. 

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, 
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install 
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product 
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information 
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified 
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made. 

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by 
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if 
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified 
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM). 

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates 
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for 
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a 
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and 
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
protocols for communication across the network. 

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in 
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented 
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code 
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying. 

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this 
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions 
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this 
License without regard to the additional permissions. 

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove 
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. 
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in 
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you 
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders 
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: 

 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the 
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 

 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or 

 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 

 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or 
    authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under
    trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service
    marks; or 

 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material 
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
    with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors. 

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further 
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you 
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of 
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying. 

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must 
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms 
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the 
applicable terms. 

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above 
requirements apply either way. 

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
paragraph of section 11). 

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation. 

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice. 

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
material under section 10. 

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a 
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring 
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a 
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than 
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered 
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who 
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work 
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous 
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the 
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can 
get it with reasonable efforts. 

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not 
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights 
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any 
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
or importing the Program or any portion of it. 

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work 
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version". 

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims 
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or 
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by 
this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but 
do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses 
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. 

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, 
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of its contributor version. 

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express 
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a 
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party. 

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and 
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to 
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have 
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
country that you have reason to believe are valid. 

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or 
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work 
and works based on it. 

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within 
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned 
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically 
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are 
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of 
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party 
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under 
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive 
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in 
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies 
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless 
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, 
prior to 28 March 2007. 

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any 
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be 
available to you under applicable patent law. 

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a 
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to 
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those 
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the 
Program. 

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission 
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, 
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will 
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special 
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, 
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination 
as such. 

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public 
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of 
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions 
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public 
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to 
choose that version for the Program. 

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or 
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR 
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing 
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute 
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in 
return for a fee.

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 


Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software 
and other kinds of works. 

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to 
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the 
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these 
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have 
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if 
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that 
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) 
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains 
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and 
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions. 

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting 
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such 
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is 
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If 
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to 
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as 
needed to protect the freedom of users. 

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 


TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds 
of works, such as semiconductor masks. 

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and 
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. 

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the 
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making 
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" 
of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. 

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based 
on the Program. 

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well. 

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through 
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" 
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible 
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells 
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent 
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under 
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent 
item in the list meets this criterion. 

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work 
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source 
form of a work. 

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language. 

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other 
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major 
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential 
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating 
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to 
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. 

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all 
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable 
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to 
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System 
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs 
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes 
interface definition files associated with source files for the work, 
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms 
and other parts of the work. 

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can 
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. 

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same 
work. 


2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a 
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your 
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. 

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, 
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having 
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the 
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not 
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for 
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and 
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your 
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. 

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes 
it unnecessary. 

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar 
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. 

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention 
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the 
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures. 

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep 
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive 
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all 
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy 
of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and 
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms 
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 


 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
    and giving a relevant date. 
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released 
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
    all notices". 

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such 
    permission if you have separately received it. 

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so. 

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and 
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not 
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in 
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of 
the aggregate. 

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of 
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable 
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these 
ways: 

 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange. 

 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for 
    as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
    product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the 
    software in the product that is covered by this License, on a 
    durable physical medium customarily used for software 
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with 
    subsection 6b. 

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the 
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) 
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the 
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is 
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you 
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
    subsection 6d. 

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded 
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included 
in conveying the object code work. 

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, 
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for 
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally 
used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, 
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which 
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the 
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the 
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the 
product. 

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, 
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install 
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product 
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information 
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified 
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made. 

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by 
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if 
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified 
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM). 

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates 
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for 
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a 
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and 
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
protocols for communication across the network. 

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in 
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented 
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code 
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying. 

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this 
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions 
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this 
License without regard to the additional permissions. 

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove 
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. 
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in 
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you 
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders 
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: 

 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the 
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 

 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or 

 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 

 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or 
    authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under
    trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service
    marks; or 

 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material 
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
    with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors. 

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further 
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you 
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of 
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying. 

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must 
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms 
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the 
applicable terms. 

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above 
requirements apply either way. 

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
paragraph of section 11). 

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation. 

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice. 

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
material under section 10. 

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a 
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring 
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a 
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than 
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered 
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who 
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work 
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous 
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the 
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can 
get it with reasonable efforts. 

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not 
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights 
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any 
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
or importing the Program or any portion of it. 

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work 
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version". 

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims 
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or 
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by 
this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but 
do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses 
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. 

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, 
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of its contributor version. 

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express 
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a 
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party. 

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and 
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to 
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have 
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
country that you have reason to believe are valid. 

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or 
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work 
and works based on it. 

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within 
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned 
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically 
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are 
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of 
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party 
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under 
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive 
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in 
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies 
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless 
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, 
prior to 28 March 2007. 

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any 
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be 
available to you under applicable patent law. 

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a 
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to 
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those 
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the 
Program. 

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission 
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, 
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will 
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special 
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, 
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination 
as such. 

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public 
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of 
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions 
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public 
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to 
choose that version for the Program. 

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or 
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR 
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing 
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute 
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in 
return for a fee.

Server Side Public License

VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

Copyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to Server Side Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
c)You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d)If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a)Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8.Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use, propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Offering the Program as a Service.
If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.

"Service Source Code" means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service, including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
