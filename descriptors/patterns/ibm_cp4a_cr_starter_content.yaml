  ## MUST exist, used to accept ibm license, valid value only can be "accept" 
  ibm_license: ""

  ## TIPS: The names of all variables in the spec field are converted to snake_case by the operator before running ansible
  ## For example, serviceAccount in the spec becomes service_account in ansible.
  ## It is recommended that you perform some type validation in Ansible on the variables to ensure that
  ## your application is receiving expected input.
  ## shared configuration among all tribe
  shared_configuration:
    ## FileNet Content Manager (FNCM) license and possible values are: user, non-production, and production.
    ## This value could be different from the rest of the licenses.
    sc_deployment_fncm_license: non-production

    ## CP4A patterns or capabilities to be deployed.  This CR represents the "content" pattern (aka FileNet Content Manager), which includes the following 
    ## mandatory components: cpe, icn (BAN/Navigator), graphql and optional components: cmis, es (External Share).
    sc_deployment_patterns: content

    ## The optional components to be installed if listed here.  This is normally populated by the User script based on input from the user.
    ## The optional components are: cmis, css (Content Search Services), es (External Share), ier (Enterprise Records), iccsap (Content Collector for SAP) and tm (Task Manager).
    ## NOTE: es does not work when using Zen and IAM for authentication.
    sc_optional_components:

    ## The deployment type as selected by the user.  Possible values are: Starter and Production.
    sc_deployment_type: Starter

    ## Specify the RunAsUser for the security context of the pod.  This is usually a numeric value that corresponds to a user ID
    sc_run_as_user: 

    ## This is the deployment platform supported for CP4A and the possible values are: ROKS, OCP, and other (which includes all Certified Kubernetes platforms)
    sc_deployment_platform: 

    sc_egress_configuration:
      ## Required. Enable or disable egress access to external systems.
      ## If "sc_restricted_internet_access" is defined and has no value set, then default will be "true". 
      ## If "sc_restricted_internet_access" is not defined (e.g., in the case of upgrade, the existing CR will not have sc_restricted_internet_access), then "sc_restricted_internet_access" will be "false"
      sc_restricted_internet_access: true
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes API server namespace(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`.
      ## "{}" can also be used as a value.  It is equivalent to all namespaces (eg: namespaceSelector:{})
      ## Default are "openshift-kube-apiserver", "openshift-apiserver" for OCP and ROKS.
      sc_api_namespace:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes API server port(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`. 
      ## Default are 443,6443 for OCP and ROKS
      sc_api_port:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes DNS service namespace(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`.
      ## "{}" can also be used as a value.  It is equivalent to all namespaces (eg: namespaceSelector:{})
      ## Default is "openshift-dns" for OCP and ROKS
      sc_dns_namespace:
      ## Optional.  Kubernetes DNS service port(s) (comma separated) to be used for egress network policy when `sc_restricted_internet_access: true` and `sc_deployment_platform: "other"`. 
      ## Default are 53,5353 for OCP and ROKS
      sc_dns_port:

    ## This is the deployment hostname suffix, this is optional and the default hostname suffix will be used as {meta.namespace}.router-canonicalhostname
    # sc_deployment_hostname_suffix:
    
    ## This is necessary if you want to use your own JDBC drivers and/or need to provide ICCSAP drivers.  If you are providing multiple JDBC drivers and ICCSAP drivers, 
    ## all the files must be compressed in a single file.
    ## First you need to package your drivers into a compressed package in the format of "saplibs/drivers_files" and/or 
    ## "jdbc/db2|oracle|postgresql|sqlserver/driver_files". For example, if you are providing your own DB2 and Oracle JDBC drivers and ICCSAP drivers, then the compressed 
    ## file should have the following structure and content:
    ##   /jdbc/db2/db2jcc4.jar
    ##   /jdbc/db2/db2jcc_license_cu.jar
    ##   /jdbc/oracle/ojdbc8.jar
    ##   /saplibs/libicudata.so.50
    ##   /saplibs/...
    ## Then you need to put the compressed package on an anonymously accessible web server and provide the link here.
    ## This CR can handle .zip files using unzip as well as .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz. Does not handle .gz files, .bz2 files, .xz, or .zst files that do not contain a .tar archive.

      sc_block_storage_classname: ""

    ## Enable/disable FIPS mode for the deployment (default value is "false")
    ## Note: If set as "true", in order to complete enablement of FIPS for CP4BA, please refer to "FIPS wall" configuration in IBM documentation.
