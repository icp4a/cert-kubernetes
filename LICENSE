IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY 

Two license agreements are presented below. 

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs 
2. IBM International Program License Agreement 

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification. 

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification. 

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation. 

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements). 

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other. 

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow. 



LICENSE INFORMATION 

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (i125-5543-06) applies. 

Program Name (Program Number): 
IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation 22.0.1 (Evaluation) 

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program. 

Evaluation Period 

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 30 days. 

License Terms delivered with Program Not Applicable 

The terms of this Agreement supersede and void any electronic "click through," "shrinkwrap," or other licensing terms and conditions included with or accompanying the Program(s). 

Multi-Product Install Image 

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software. 

Bundled Programs 

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Bundled Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Supporting Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program. 

Authorized User 

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person. 

Concurrent Connection 

Concurrent Connection is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent Connection is a simultaneous link or association of a database, application, server, or any other type of device which has been or is made available to the Program. Licensee must obtain entitlements for the total number of Concurrent Connections, which have been or are made to the Program. 

Concurrent User 

Concurrent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent User is a person who is accessing the Program at any particular point in time. Regardless of whether the person is simultaneously accessing the Program multiple times, the person counts only as a single Concurrent User. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers, but Licensee must obtain entitlements for the maximum number of Concurrent Users simultaneously accessing the Program. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each simultaneous Concurrent User accessing the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. 

Install 

Install is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Install is an installed copy of the Program on a physical or virtual disk made available to be executed on a computer. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Install of the Program. 

Process 

Process is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Process is an instance of the Program being executed. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the total number of Processes executing at any point in time. 

Virtual Processor Core 

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program. 

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

Virtual Server 

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server. 

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program. 

Million Event 
A Million Event is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Million Event is a log event generated from a server, application or device that can be processed for a specific purpose, rounded up to the nearest million. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of Million Events to be collected and processed by the Program at any time.

Red Hat Products are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. The below entitlement restrictions apply solely to any Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program and do not restrict Licensee's use of the Red Hat Products, which are licensed separately. Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements), with the exception of the IBM backup policy and temporary use policy as referenced in the International Program License Agreement, which govern backups and temporary use for Red Hat Products included in the Program.

- “Additional Flat Entitlement” means that regardless of the number of entitlements obtained to the Program, Licensee’s use of the listed program is limited to the number of entitlement(s) listed.

If the Client has acquired the Program as a result of agreeing to the terms of the addendum titled “IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation and IBM Business Automation Workflow User-Based Trade Up and Subscription License Upgrade Restriction,” then the Client must measure deployment for the trade up and subscription license upgrade on the user-based metrics of Authorized User, Employee User, External User, Concurrent User, and/or Infrequent User. No other metric shall be used for deployment measurement for license trade up and subscription license upgrade and subsequent additional license to this Program.

Use of Usage Metering Data 
The Program enables use of a usage metering dashboard (the "Dashboard") that enables the display and monitoring of certain data and metrics regarding Licensee's deployment and usage of IBM and non-IBM software programs, as well as the computing environment on which they are deployed ("Usage Metering Data"). Usage of the Dashboard requires registration on either the Red Hat Marketplace or IBM Software Central. Licensee's usage of the Dashboard and IBM's use and sharing of Usage Metering Data are governed by the terms of the Service Description for the Red Hat Marketplace, Operated by IBM, available here: https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms?id=i126-8719, and if Licensee enables or uses the Dashboard, Licensee agrees to those terms. 

Infrequent User 

Infrequent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. Any Infrequent Users given access to the Program requires an entitlement. An Infrequent User is an Authorized User who accesses the Program not more than one hundred twenty (120) times in any consecutive 12 month period. A single access is comprised of one or more interactions between the Infrequent User and the Program or actions performed on behalf of the Infrequent User by the Program, all within a consecutive 15 minute period. 

Licensee must track accesses by Infrequent Users to verify that they meet the access limitations of Infrequent Users. Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors details of the tracking mechanism described above, upon request. 

Employee User 

Employee User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Employee User is a unique person employed in Licensee's Enterprise, whether or not given access to the Program, or a unique person otherwise paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Employee User is unique to that Employee User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person. Licensee must acquire sufficient employee user entitlements to cover all employees and any other unique persons paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise. 

External User 

External User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An External User is a unique person, not employed in, paid by, or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise, who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. A person who is employed in or paid by Licensee's Enterprise, but is not accessing the Program within the scope of that relationship may be an External User. An entitlement for an External User is unique to that External User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person. 

Additional IBM DB2 Standard Edition Details 

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.
