    ## be defaulted to production.  This value could be different from the other licenses in the CR.

    ## All CP4A components must use/share the image_pull_secrets to pull images
    image_pull_secrets:
    - ibm-entitlement-key

    ## All CP4A components must use/share the same docker image repository.  For example, if IBM Entitled Registry is used, then
    ## it should be "cp.icr.io".  Otherwise, it will be a local docker registry.
    sc_image_repository: cp.icr.io

    ## Specify the RunAsUser for the security context of the pod.  This is usually a numeric value that corresponds to a user ID.
    ## For non-OCP (e.g., CNCF platforms such as AWS, GKE, etc), this parameter is optional. It is not supported on OCP and ROKS.
    sc_run_as_user:

    ## If your Openshift cluster is configured for Hugepages and you want the applicable deployment resources to consume Hugepages.

    ## For more information on seccomp please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/ and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/security/seccomp-profiles.html
    ## NOTE: Defining a custom, localhost seccomp profile that is stricter than the default RuntimeDefault profile may cause our pods fail to start.  This custom profile should be created at the worker nodes.
    sc_seccomp_profile:
    #  type: # RuntimeDefault, Localhost, Unconfined
    #  localhost_profile: # Local path of custom seccomp profile when type `Localhost` is used. The custom profile must be accessible by the pod and must exist locally on all worker nodes.  For example: `/profiles/fine-grained.json`.

    ## This is necessary if you want to use your own JDBC drivers and/or need to provide ICCSAP drivers.  If you are providing multiple JDBC drivers and ICCSAP drivers,
    ## all the files must be compressed in a single file.
    ## First you need to package your drivers into a compressed package in the format of "saplibs/drivers_files" and/or
    ## "jdbc/db2|oracle|postgresql|sqlserver/driver_files". For example, if you are providing your own DB2 and Oracle JDBC drivers and ICCSAP drivers, then the compressed

    ##   /jdbc/db2/db2jcc4.jar
    ##   /jdbc/db2/db2jcc_license_cu.jar
    ##   /jdbc/oracle/ojdbc8.jar
    ##   /saplibs/libicudata.so.50
    ##   /saplibs/...
    ## Then you need to put the compressed package on an anonymously accessible web server and provide the link here.
    ## The CR can handle .zip files using unzip as well as .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz. Does not handle .gz files, .bz2 files, .xz, or .zst files that do not contain a .tar archive.
